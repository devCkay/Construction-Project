 ðŸš€ Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge! ðŸ’»  Today marks the beginning of my 100-day coding journey, and Iâ€™m excited to share my progress! I successfully coded the menu/header section, part of the main section, and the footer using HTML and CSS.   A big shoutout to my coding companion, Clause AI, for assisting me along the way. Looking forward to what the next 99 days will bring!  Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this challenge! ðŸ’ª #WebDevelopment #CodingJourney #HTML #CSS #LearningToCode
